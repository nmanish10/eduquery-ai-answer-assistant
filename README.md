# EduQuery

EduQuery is an AI-powered academic assistant designed to help students receive structured, concise answers to their exam-related questions based on content from their study materials â€” including textbooks, PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and handwritten notes.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Aim

Our goal is to build a system that enables:

- ðŸ“„ **Document Understanding**: Extract meaningful text from various educational content formats like PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and even notebook images.
- ðŸ§  **Context-Aware Answering**: Use the extracted content to retrieve relevant information and generate well-structured responses to user queries.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Mark-based Answer Generation**: Adapt the response style and depth based on the marks allocated to the question (e.g., 2, 5, or 10 marks).
- ðŸ”Š **Optional Accessibility Features**: Support for features like text-to-speech to aid accessibility.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features (Planned)

- Upload multiple types of study materials  
- Automatically extract and organize educational content  
- Allow students to enter questions and desired marks  
- Retrieve relevant content and generate concise academic answers  
- Friendly web interface for easy interaction  

## ðŸ§© Project Structure (To Be Built)

- **Frontend** â€“ A simple and intuitive interface to upload files and ask questions  
- **Backend** â€“ Core logic for content extraction, context retrieval, and answer generation  
- **Data Handling** â€“ Preprocessing of various file types and efficient chunking  
- **Answer Engine** â€“ Smart generation of exam-ready responses using context-aware AI  

> While the system is still under development, we are encouraged to contribute and experiment. The backend will also support modular integration, allowing individual workstreams to function independently.
